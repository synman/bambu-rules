## Knowledge Escalation Policy

When baked-in knowledge does not fully answer a question about Bambu Lab protocol,
API behavior, or firmware semantics, follow this mandatory 3-tier escalation:

### Tier 1 — MCP's Own Knowledge (always first)
Read the knowledge/ modules via bambu://knowledge/* resources or get_knowledge_topic():

**Top-level topics:**
- behavioral_rules — ⚠️ safety rules, write protection, interface rules, session rules
- protocol — MQTT topics, telemetry semantics, HMS, firmware, SSDP, 3MF
- enums — all enum values and meanings
- api_reference — BambuPrinter method signatures and MCP tool mapping
- http_api — HTTP REST API: dynamic base URL (call `get_server_info()` to discover `api_port`), auth, route category index

**Sub-topics (fetch on demand when parent summary points here):**
- behavioral_rules/camera — camera tools, stream HUD overlay, data_uri handling
- behavioral_rules/print_state — gcode_state FAILED semantics, HMS active/historical, stage codes
- behavioral_rules/methodology — KISS, quality-first, verification, parity, cross-model
- behavioral_rules/mcp_patterns — array parameter pattern, multi-level hierarchy, compressed responses
- protocol/concepts — full glossary: FDM, MQTT, HMS, 3MF, AMS, camera protocols, LAN mode
- protocol/mqtt — MQTT topics, message types, push_status, bitfields, xcam fields
- protocol/hms — HMS error structure, print_error integer, firmware upgrade state
- protocol/3mf — 3MF structure, SSDP, AMS info parsing, FTPS, H2D extruder block
- api_reference/session — BambuPrinter constructor, session management, send_gcode
- api_reference/files — FTPS file management methods
- api_reference/print — print control, temperature, and fan speed methods
- api_reference/ams — AMS, spool, calibration, hardware, and AI detector methods
- api_reference/state — properties, print_option; call api_reference/dataclasses for full types
- api_reference/dataclasses — BambuConfig, PrinterCapabilities, BambuState, BambuSpool, ProjectInfo, ActiveJobInfo
- enums/printer — PrinterModel, PrinterSeries, ActiveTool, ServiceState, AirConditioningMode
- enums/ams — AMSModel, AMSSeries, AMS control/user/heating/dry enums, TrayState, ExtruderInfoState
- enums/filament — NozzleDiameter, NozzleType, NozzleFlowType, PlateType, PrintOption, Stage mappings
- http_api/printer — printer state and session management routes
- http_api/print — print control routes (start, pause, stop, speed, skip, gcode)
- http_api/ams — AMS and filament routes
- http_api/climate — temperature, fan, and lighting routes
- http_api/hardware — nozzle configuration and AI vision detector routes
- http_api/files — SD card file management routes
- http_api/system — system, diagnostics, and API documentation routes

**"Exhausted Tier 1" means all of the following:**
1. Checked the relevant knowledge sub-topics (e.g. `api_reference/state`, `enums/ams`).
2. Called ALL targeted MCP tools relevant to the question category — not just `get_printer_state()`.
   Examples: for filament state → `get_spool_info()`, `get_ams_units()`; for capabilities →
   `get_capabilities()`; for print options → `get_printer_state()` + confirm field is absent.
3. The specific field or answer is confirmed absent across ALL relevant targeted tools.

Only then escalate to Tier 1b.

### Tier 1b — bambu-mcp Local HTTP REST API Fallback
If the targeted MCP tools do not expose a required field or action, check the
**bambu-mcp local HTTP REST API** before escalating to Tier 2.

**⚠️ Critical distinction — two HTTP endpoints exist; only one belongs here:**

| Endpoint | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| `http://localhost:{api_port}/api` — bambu-mcp local REST API | **Tier 1b** — broader route coverage than MCP tools; always try before Tier 2 |
| Any remote/external API (outside localhost) | **Never** an escalation step — not part of this sequence at any tier |

→ Call `get_server_info()` to discover `api_port`.
→ Call `get_knowledge_topic('http_api')` for the route index.
→ Then call the appropriate sub-topic (e.g. `get_knowledge_topic('http_api/print')`).

### Tier 2 — Authoritative Sources from Rules Files (primary fallback)
Use `search_authoritative_sources(query)` scoped to the repositories identified
in the workspace rules files as authoritative. Search in this priority order:

1. BambuStudio (bambulab/BambuStudio) — official protocol, firmware, slicer
2. ha-bambulab/pybambu (greghesp/ha-bambulab) — field semantics, edge cases
3. OpenBambuAPI (Doridian/OpenBambuAPI) — undocumented protocol
4. X1Plus (X1Plus/X1Plus) — firmware internals, low-level telemetry
5. OrcaSlicer (OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer) — slicer, 3MF, plate handling
6. bambu-node (THE-SIMPLE-MARK/bambu-node) — cross-language verification
7. Bambu-HomeAssistant-Flows (WolfwithSword/Bambu-HomeAssistant-Flows) — node-RED

If Tier 2 answers the question, note the source and proceed.

### Tier 3 — Broader Search (last resort, premium-gated)
If both Tier 1 and Tier 2 fail to provide an answer:
- Broaden GitHub code search to all repositories (no repo filter)
- Search GitHub issues/PRs on the known reference repos
- Web search — **requires explicit user confirmation first** (Premium Requests rule);
  state what you intend to search and why, then wait for approval before searching.

**Always flag Tier 3 answers as potentially less reliable.**
