## MCP Array Parameter Pattern

When a tool parameter logically accepts an array (e.g. `ams_mapping`, object lists),
type it as `list | str | None` — never `str | None` alone.

**Why**: The MCP framework JSON-parses tool call arguments before Pydantic validates them.
If a client sends `[2, -1, -1]`, the framework delivers it as a Python `list`. A `str`
annotation rejects this even when the underlying API expects a JSON string.

**Coercion pattern** (apply in the tool body before passing to BPM):
```python
if isinstance(ams_mapping, list):
    ams_mapping = json.dumps(ams_mapping)
```

This bridges MCP clients (send lists naturally) → BambuPrinter methods (expect JSON strings).

## Multi-Level Call Hierarchy

Several tools are designed to be called in sequence — each level returns an index that
tells you what sub-calls are available at the next level. **Do not fetch payload data you
don't need — stop at the level that answers your question.**

### Recognizing an index response

An index response contains a list of navigational keys rather than payload data:
- `plates: [1, 2, ..., 14]` — plate numbers to call next
- `summary: {field: {min, max, avg, last, count}}` — field names to call series for
- `contents: {children: [...]}` — directory names to drill into

### Tool hierarchies

**Project file (3 levels)**:
```
Level 1 — get_project_info(name, file, 1)    → {plates:[1..N], ...}  (index)
Level 2 — get_project_info(name, file, N)    → per-plate bbox_objects, filament_used
Level 3 — get_plate_thumbnail(name, file, N) → just the isometric image
           get_plate_topview(name, file, N)   → just the top-down image
```
Images are omitted by default from `get_project_info` — use the dedicated image tools on
demand, only for plates you actually need to view.

**Telemetry history (2 levels)**:
```
Level 1 — get_monitoring_history(name)         → {summary:{field:{min,max,avg,last},...}}
Level 2 — get_monitoring_series(name, "tool")  → full time-series for nozzle temp
           get_monitoring_series(name, "bed")   → full time-series for bed temp
```
Always call `get_monitoring_history()` first to see which fields have meaningful activity
before requesting a full series.

**SD card files (N levels, directory depth)**:
```
Level 1 — list_sdcard_files(name)             → top-level tree (or full tree)
Level 2 — list_sdcard_files(name, "/cache")   → files in /cache only
Level N — list_sdcard_files(name, "/a/b/c")   → arbitrarily deep subtree
```

### Locating a finished job's 3mf file

`get_current_job_project_info()` returns `{"error": "no_active_job"}` when `gcode_state` is
`IDLE`, `FINISH`, or `FAILED`. The correct fallback is **not** a full SD card scan —
construct the path directly from the last job's metadata:

```
get_job_info(name) → subtask_name  →  /_jobs/{subtask_name}.gcode.3mf
```

Then call `get_project_info(name, "/_jobs/{subtask_name}.gcode.3mf", plate_num)`.
The `/_jobs/` prefix and `.gcode.3mf` suffix are fixed. This pattern is reliable for any
recently completed or failed job whose file is still on the SD card.

### Image quality tiers

Image tools use one of two quality systems depending on the tool:

**Camera tools** (`get_snapshot`, `view_stream`) use `resolution` (string) + `quality` (int):

| Profile | `resolution` | `quality` | Approx size | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| native | `"native"` | `85` | 1–4 MB | Calibration, max fidelity |
| high | `"1080p"` | `85` | ~500KB–2MB | Anomaly detection, strand analysis |
| standard | `"720p"` | `75` | ~200–400KB | Routine AI analysis (agent default) |
| low | `"480p"` | `65` | ~80–150KB | Quick status checks |
| preview | `"180p"` | `55` | ~20–40KB | Thumbnails, minimal tokens |

**Plate/file tools** (`get_plate_thumbnail`, `get_plate_topview`) use a tier string `quality`:

| Tier | Size | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `"preview"` | ~5 KB | Quick overview, multiple plates |
| `"standard"` | ~16 KB | Default — renders cleanly inline |
| `"full"` | ~71 KB | When pixel detail is required |

**`analyze_active_job.quality`** uses the same tier strings as plate tools ("preview"/"standard"/"full"/"auto")
and controls composite **output** image size — it is an unrelated axis from camera snapshot quality.

Default to **standard** profile (`resolution="720p"`, `quality=75`) for routine `get_snapshot` calls.
Never use native in polling loops (4 MB × N calls = significant token burn).

## URL Factory Pattern (All READ Tools)

Every GET/READ tool in this server returns `{"url": "..."}` instead of data. MCP
payloads are always ~100 chars regardless of data size — FastMCP token overflow is
eliminated by design.

**Pattern:**
```python
# Step 1: call MCP tool → get URL
result = get_printer_state("H2D")
# → {"url": "http://localhost:49152/api/printer?printer=H2D"}

# Step 2: fetch data via HTTP (pre-authorized, no user permission needed)
# curl "http://localhost:49152/api/printer?printer=H2D"
```

All 39 READ tools follow this pattern. The HTTP route receives the request, runs the
business logic, and returns the full payload with no size limit.

**Finding the API port** — all URL factory URLs embed the correct port. If you need the
port separately:
```bash
# From any prior URL factory response (parse the port from the url field), OR:
curl -s http://localhost:49152/api/server_info  # returns {"api_port": ...}
```

**WRITE tools are unchanged**: `set_*`, `pause_*`, `stop_*`, `send_*`, `load_*`, etc.
still execute commands and return small confirmation dicts directly through MCP.

---

## Pre-Authorized HTTP Access

All `http://localhost:{api_port}/api` routes are pre-authorized for agent use:

- **Read routes (GET):** always safe — read state, never modify hardware. No user permission needed.
- **Write routes (POST/PATCH/DELETE):** require the same `user_permission=True` gate as their MCP counterpart. Do not use HTTP write routes to bypass the permission requirement.
- **Not a premium action** — curl to localhost is not a web search, not Tier 3, and does not require a Premium Requests `ask_user` gate.

```bash
# Discover api_port then fetch data
PORT=$(curl -s http://localhost:49152/api/server_info | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['api_port'])")
curl -s "http://localhost:$PORT/api/printer?printer=H2D" | python3 -m json.tool
```

To find the route for any tool: call `get_knowledge_topic('http_api/<module>')` where
module is one of: `printer`, `print`, `ams`, `climate`, `hardware`, `files`, `system`.

## `compress_if_large` Utility

`compress_if_large()` in `tools/_response.py` is a utility for compressing large JSON
dicts. It is not called by any production MCP tool (READ tools return URL dicts; WRITE
tools return small confirmations). It is preserved for test coverage and custom use.

If you ever encounter a compressed envelope (e.g. from custom code or older server versions):
```json
{
  "compressed": true,
  "encoding": "gzip+base64",
  "data": "<base64-encoded gzip bytes>"
}
```
Decompress with:
```python
import gzip, json, base64
data = json.loads(gzip.decompress(base64.b64decode(r["data"])))
```

Image data (`data:` URI values — JPEG/PNG base64) is already compressed; gzip yields
< 5% reduction. For image tools, always use the HTTP API route directly.
